            In the investing world, money talks. On rare occasions, however, vindication is even better than a giant mountain of cash. Over the past decade, the true believers of the cryptocurrency revolution have turned what was once considered an oddball peanut gallery in the financial world into the next trillion-dollar asset class. And as they count their digital coins, they're ready to take a bow.

            “Bitcoin has surpassed Facebook $FB in market cap," tweeted Cameron Winklevoss as bitcoin soared over $40,000 per coin, then $41,000 and beyond, on Friday. Added Winklevoss, "Makes sense that a money network would be more valuable than a social network.” Sure, the Winklevii still have a lot of catching up to do—Mark Zuckerberg is worth $94 billion—but the bravado isn't exactly misguided: The recent surge in crypto means that Forbes estimates each of the Winklevii owns $1.4 billion in digital assets, as of Monday morning, more than double what they were worth just a month ago.

            Over the past year, the gravity-defying stock market has given most investors a reason to grin, but none are smiling wider than bitcoin holders. While the S&P 500 has jumped 17% from the start of January 2020 through January 11, 2021, bitcoin has spiked 400% in that same time, breaching $40,000 a coin and sweeping other digital assets into its rising tide. All cryptocurrencies are now collectively worth more than $920 billion, according to crypto research site Messari, down from roughly $1 trillion on Friday.

             <p class="leading-6 py-2">
             One key factor driving the frenzy: As Covid led the Federal Reserve to print trillions of dollars to stimulate the economy and head off a recession, investors increasingly saw bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Unlike the 2017 price rally from $1,000 to $19,000, which was driven by retail investors, the recent uptick has been propelled by large institutional investments and a proliferation of ways to buy and store crypto.

            Along the way, some crypto investors have gotten very rich. At least five have recently crossed into the billionaire ranks, possibly quite a few more. Using everything from publicly available digital wallets to old-fashioned reporting, we set out to identify some of the biggest winners of this latest crypto boom. It is by no means a complete ranking but captures just how much some fortunes have soared.
